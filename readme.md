# Subscribe
Subscribe is an interface to keep track of all your favorite media releases.
With Subscribe you will never forget when a new show is coming out, plus you can track and share which shows and movies you've watched.

## Todo
Validate shows added.
Find an API for movies and add them.
Find an API for anime and add that.
Allow users to add subscriptions with one click (using VueJS)
Cry because Laravel or Guzzle does some weirdly inconsistant stuff in controller and tinker.

## Issues
In Tinker I can't get show data, this same function does work in the controller.
